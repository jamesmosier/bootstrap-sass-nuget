bootstrap-sass-nuget (v 3.3.3)
==============================

Unofficial bootstrap-sass [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Twitter.Bootstrap.Sass/) ... well it's the only NuGet package at the moment for Bootstrap SASS!

Based on source from [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)

**Release Notes (v3.3.3):** This is Bootstrap source version 3.3.2. The bootstrap-sass team released v3.3.3 a few hours after the v3.3.2 release to "Fix glyphicons regression" ([https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases](see release history here)). 

<hr/>
Note: I was going  to make this "*official*" and hopefully pull it into the [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) project, but perhaps Outercurve will do this instead? See [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/pull/583) for more info.
