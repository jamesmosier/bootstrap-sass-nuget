bootstrap-sass-nuget (v 3.3.7)
==============================

Unofficial bootstrap-sass [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Twitter.Bootstrap.Sass/) ... well it's the only NuGet package at the moment for Bootstrap SASS!

Based directly on source from [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) (it's a direct copy with no modifications). 

## Note

I was going  to make this "*official*" and hopefully pull it into the [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) project, but perhaps Outercurve will do this instead? See [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/pull/583) for more info.
